# css : IN VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT

a few css modules that I sometimes find useful as "drop in functionality".

**NOTE:** this is a very quick thrown together outline of a few ideas I have. None are complete or tested as yet and I'll most likely be switching them to use stylus or less, instead of vanilla CSS, once I make up my mind.

- [box](box) — flexbox related thingamajig.
- [col](col) — multi-column crappola.
- [form](form) — leaving the styling to your hearts desire, this is — going to be — more about the layout of fields.
- [datagrid](datagrid) — putting the `able` into sexy data tables.
- [grid](grid) — grid based layouts redux!
- [img](img) — image replacement whatchamahoozas.
- [list](list) — it's in one now!
- [mebug](mebug) — helping your CSS **me**dia query de**bug**ing.
- [reset](reset) — you know what this is, don't make me hurt you.
- [transam](transam) — animate, transform and transition goodness.
