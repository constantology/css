# box.css

encapsulates minimum functionality for creating `HBox` and `VBox` elements using the new CSS3 flex box module — as well as the old CSS3 box module and table display as fall-backs.

## About

This is not an exhaustive representation of the complete flex box spec.

Rather it tries to provide a reasonable amount of functionality to achieve more common layouts using flex box styles.

**NOTE:** Since flex box is not properly supported by all major browsers yet, you may get unexpected results from certain combinations. **It is for this reason** that only cross browser compatible rules have been included; for now.

## How to use it

See [test page](test.html) for examples on how to get the most out of using `box.css`.

## Support

Works correctly in stable Chrome and Opera, MSIE 10 and Webkit nightly.

Partial support in FireFox — stable and nightly — and Safari stable.
